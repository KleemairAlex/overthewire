## Concept learned
- Secure remote access with ssh  <br><br>

## Commands used
- ssh[^1]  <br><br>

### Walkthrough
So to connect to the overthewire host of the first level **you can _not_ just run**
```
ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org 
```
You also need a username so the exact level can be clarified. 
To clarify the username simply write the username with an @ before the host.
After hitting enter you are prompted for the password which is provided on the [overthewire website](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html).
