## Concept learned
- Working with hexdumps  
- Identifying file types  <br><br>

## Commands used
- file
- ls
- cd
- mv
- xxd[^1]
- gzip[^2]
- tar[^3]
- bzip2[^4]
- mktemp[^5]<br><br>

### Walkthrough
1.  Connect to the overthewire host with the username bandit12 and the password you found in the previous level.
2.  Inside the home directory, you will find a file named **data.txt**. When you open it with `cat`, the content clearly looks like a **hexdump**.
3.  Before we restore the orginal file you have to make a temporary directory using ```mktemp -d``` and ```cd``` into the new directory
4.  Reverse the hexdump using:
    ```
    xxd -r data.txt data.bin
    ```
5.  Identify the file type of the restored file:
    ```
    file data.bin
    ```
6.  This level contains multiple layers of encoded files.  
    Each time you extract a file, you receive *another compressed file*.  
    So you must repeatedly:
    - check the file type  
    - extract it  
    - inspect the new file
7.  Use the following commands depending on what ```file``` tells you:
      <br><br>**If it is a POSIX tar archive:**<br>
      `tar -xf filename`
      <br><br>**If it is gzip compressed:**<br>
      `
      mv filename file.gz
      gzip -d file.gz
      `
      <br><br>**If it is bzip2 compressed:**<br>
      `
      mv filename file.bz2
      bzip2 -d file.bz2
      `
      <br><br>After each extraction, run:<br>
      `
      file newfile
      `<br><br>
8. Continue decoding layer by layer until you eventually get a readable ASCII text file.
9.  The ASCII text file will contain the password. Copy it into your text file and disconnect from the current level.
